Dear faculty teaching in 3rd and 4th terms,
 
We know most of you are focused on first term at the moment, but we wanted to reach out with a reminder of our guidance and course change deadlines for your upcoming courses. As you can see from the linked document, since registration for terms 3 & 4 opens on November 13, 2023, we need departments/programs to submit any changes to courses, including section changes, in the Course System by September 30, 2023. 
 
We hope that you have been working with your departmental academic office already to meet this timeline – but if not, you can check the current listing for your course(s) in the Course Directory. When you do so, make sure to select AY23-24. Please see the Course/Section Numbers Explained page for a description of course section formats and associated numbers. Please check the instruction method and course times listed and confirm that they are accurate. If the information in the Course Directory is not accurate, please work with your department’s academic office to submit any needed changes as soon as possible. Please also check your course’s prerequisites and enrollment restrictions to ensure they are appropriate for your course – specifically, you might consider including a requirement of instructor consent for undergraduate registration in your course if there are concerns about potentially not having enough space in the course for our master’s and doctoral students.  
 
Some course changes require approvals from the Committee on Academic Standards levels, so we urge you to have all changes submitted to the Course Management System (CMS) as soon as possible, as we cannot process approvals without a CMS submission.  
 
Thank you very much for all you do, year after year, to provide our students with the best public health education available, anywhere in the world! 
 
Sincerely,
