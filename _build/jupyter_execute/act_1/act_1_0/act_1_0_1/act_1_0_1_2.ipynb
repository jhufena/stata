    "Given your existing technical stack, there are several ways you could make quiz results available instantly to students. Here are some approaches, tailored to the tools you're familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Jupyter Notebook and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you already use `.ipynb` notebooks, you could design your quiz as a Jupyter Notebook. Using Python code cells, you can evaluate quiz answers and provide immediate feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example Python Code for a Multiple-Choice Question\n",
    "question_1 = input(\"What is the command to import Excel files into Stata? \")\n",
    "\n",
    "if question_1.lower() == \"import excel\":\n",
    "    print(\"Correct! Moving to the next question.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is 'import excel'.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. GitHub, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use GitHub Pages to host a simple website where students can take the quiz.\n",
    "- Create the quiz as a form (possibly using HTML and JavaScript).\n",
    "- Use GitHub Actions to automatically score the quiz when a student submits their answers and then update the GitHub Pages site with their score and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. VS Code and Shell Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "You could develop shell scripts to automate the process of quiz taking. While this may not be the most user-friendly interface for everyone, it could work well for a more technical audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Example Shell Script\n",
    "echo \"What is the command to import Excel files into Stata?\"\n",
    "read answer\n",
    "\n",
    "if [ \"$answer\" == \"import excel\" ]; then\n",
    "    echo \"Correct!\"\n",
    "else\n",
    "    echo \"Incorrect. The correct answer is 'import excel'.\"\n",
    "fi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. R in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your comfort with R, you can also design the quiz in a Jupyter notebook using the R kernel. Just like Python, R can provide immediate output and can be great for statistical analyses that you might want to include in your quizzes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Example R Code for a Multiple-Choice Question\n",
    "answer <- readline(prompt = \"What is the command to import Excel files into Stata? \")\n",
    "\n",
    "if (answer == \"import excel\") {\n",
    "  print(\"Correct! Moving to the next question.\")\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "  print(\"Incorrect. The correct answer is 'import excel'.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Embedding Media\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you plan to use embedded media like YouTube videos, you can use HTML or Markdown within Jupyter notebooks or on GitHub Pages to include these resources. The same mediums could display quiz questions followed by this interactive content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Real-time Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "In an advanced setting, you could use WebSockets for real-time interaction, although this would be more complex to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your existing workflow and tools, combining Python in Jupyter notebooks with GitHub Pages for hosting seems like a natural fit. You can write code to evaluate quiz answers in Jupyter and use GitHub Actions to automate the scoring and feedback process, which will be presented on the GitHub Pages website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to provide immediate feedback with additional resources for learning, as this will help them understand what they need to focus on for improvement."
