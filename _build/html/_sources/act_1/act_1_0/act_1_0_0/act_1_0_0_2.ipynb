    "It's fantastic to hear that you're developing new courses tailored to meet the diverse needs of your students at Johns Hopkins University. The breakdown into beginner, intermediate, and advanced courses is a sensible way to cater to different skill levels. Here are some suggestions that may assist you in refining your course proposals:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Assessment:\n",
    "Before the course begins, offer a self-assessment or quiz for students to evaluate their own skill levels. This can help them identify which course would be most appropriate for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Peer Collaboration:\n",
    "Allow students to work in peer-programming sessions. This is an excellent way for beginners to learn from those who are slightly more advanced, and for advanced students to solidify their understanding by teaching concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Project:\n",
    "In each course, include a culminating project that combines all the skills learned. This will help in the practical application of skills.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outreach and Promotion\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've structured your courses, consider collaborating with other departments to expand the courses' reach. For example, you might work with the School of Medicine or the Sociology Department, where many students might need data analysis skills but lack programming knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to adapt these ideas as you see fit. Good luck with your course development!\n"
